The main workflow is located in the machine_learning folder, which is organized into six files for better structure. All files should be placed in the same folder. If any files cannot be found, an adjustment of the sys.path at the beginning of the main.py file may be required. The variables.py file holds key globally defined variables for quick and easy modifications, including various path variables. A more detailed description of each variable can be found within the file.
